 SharpShooter Game

SharpShooter is a fun and interactive shooting simulation game built in Java using the Swing library. Players can aim with a gun sight and experience simulated acceleration as they move their aim. Try to hit the center of the target for maximum points!

## Features:
- **Gun Sight Movement:** Use arrow keys to move the gun sight around.
- **Acceleration Simulation:** Feel the sight speed up and slow down as you move it, mimicking real-world acceleration.
- **Handshaking:** In real life, hitting a target requires particular skills and composure. The game simulates that your hands are shaking, or maybe the wind is blowing.
- **Score System:** Aim close to the center for higher scores. Keep track of your score and bullets left in the status bar.
